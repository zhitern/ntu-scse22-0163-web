# Getting started with the application

This project consist of 2 parts, the frontend (this folder) and the backend folder.

## Step 1, starting the React server

Download `Node.js` from https://nodejs.org/en/download.

Open terminal and cd to this directory.

Run `npm install` to install the necessary libraries.

Run `npm start` to start the React server, the application should open in your default browser.

## Step 2, starting the Backend server

Download Python if you do not have it installed.

Open terminal and cd to the `backend` directory, the backend folder is seperated from the React project.

Install the required python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

If there are still missing packages, install them respectively.

Allow external assembly files by right clicking the `ITR.dll` file in the backend folder, then click properties and click unblock at the bottom.

Run `python server.py` to start the backend server. This may take 1 - 3 minutes. Once you see the "servering at port 8000" message, the server has began to work.
